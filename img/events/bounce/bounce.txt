Before the impending wave of requirements, exams, and stress - akin to almost any semester in UP - CIEMers started their academic year by attending BOUNCE: CrossFit, the first of many lined up for the semester. Held last August 14, 2017 at the Pound for Pound Fitness Diliman, attendees were trained by Coach Jon. Each attendee had to cyclically go through a round of 12 stations. After every round, CIEMers were given 3-5 minutes of rest. The stations were different from each other - each station was supposed to exercise a specific muscle or body part (i.e. sit-ups for the core muscles, pushups for the arms and shoulders, etc.) All in all, it was a tiring but fulfilling day for all the participants.

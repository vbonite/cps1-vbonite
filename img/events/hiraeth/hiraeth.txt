Held last March 31 - exactly a year after the misfortune - UP CIEM organized Hiraeth, a benefit concert for the UP Faculty Center and its community. The event aimed to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the UP Faculty Center and to spread awareness through sharing the stories of the people affected by the tragedy. It is in the spirit of Hiraeth to reminisce the deep history of UP Faculty Center as a symbol of accomplishment and hard work, and as the home of the university's current and past torchbearers of knowledge. Music filled the night with performances from Ourselves the Elves, Fools and Foes, Brisom, Oswald Sleeps Tonight - OST, Wish Sticks, The Roomhoppers, and Aninag Anino. Spoken word artists Jerome Almanza and Jenilyn Manzon of KM64, Dani Nakpil, and Miggy Arnonobal also graced the event with their pieces about nationalism and the youth of today. Article by Mark Rendon

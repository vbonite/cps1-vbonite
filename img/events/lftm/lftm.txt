Writing can serve a million purposes: to inform, to express one's self, to inspire, to entertain, but most importantly - to tell a story. Last October 2016, the Publication and Records Committee of UP CIEM conducted the first installment for this academic year of Learn from the Masters (LFTM). The series aim to educate the members on skills essential for publicity and secretariat tasks. This semester, the event focused on journalism and creative writing. Mr. Bryan Ezra Gonzales, a BA Journalism student in UP Diliman and current Vice President for Academic Affairs of UP Journalism Club, talked about the basic principles of journalism. On the other hand, Ms. Dany Abuel and Ms. Mia Noelle Rodriguez, a BA Creative Writing and BA Journalism student, respectively, introduced the creative non-fiction genre in literature. Surely, everyone who attended the event acquired a lot of knowledge which are useful in understanding the ever-changing landscape of media and literature.

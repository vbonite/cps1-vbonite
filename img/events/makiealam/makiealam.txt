An educational discussion on the Republic Act 10931 or "Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act" was held by the External Affairs Committee as part of the MakIEalam project last September 14, 2017 at the Melchor Hall, College of Engineering. Mr. David Baldiva, Mr. Ezron Cabrera, Mr. Paul Christian Yang-Ed were invited to give different perspectives on the context and implementation of the said act. Mr. Baldiva, president of the UP Economics Towards Consciousness, a student of the UP school of Economics shared his insights about scarcity of Philippine resources; giving emphasis on opportunity costs, resource allocation, paying capacity and sustainability. He then applied economics concepts to discuss whether or not the decision to allocate resources on free tuition was the best option. On the other hand, Mr. Cabrera and Mr. Yang-Ed, Secretary General and Vice Chairperson of Agham Youth focused on discussing the feasibility study conducted on the free tuition act. They presented numbers to give an accurate estimate on the required budget to sustain free education and how it can be afforded by the government. They also gave rebuttals on the Commission on higher Education’s (CHED) statements on why the free tuition act should not be passed. The Free tuition act gives full tuition and miscellaneous fee subsidy for students in 112 State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), local universities and colleges, and state-run technical-vocational schools. Estimates have been given by different experts but have yet to come up with a definite amount ranging from 9 Billion to 100 Billion. There hasn’t been an announcement from the government whether or not the act is to be continued for the succeeding years. Photos taken by Lianne Gappi. Article by Phillip Galacio.

Outlook is a non-committal event that aims to introduce UP CIEM to the students outside the organization. Held last September 13, the event kicked off with a light ice breaker to acquaint the attendees with the resident members. The organization was joined by two speakers: Jeiel Ruth Regala, a resident member, and Mr. Jesus Lorenzo Guerrero, an alumnus of the organization. Ms. Regala presented the events and projects of UP CIEM as well as the achievements of the organization through the years. Afterwards, Mr. Guerrero gave a lighthearted talk on how UP CIEM molded him to become an excellent student leader way back in his undergraduate days and how the values of the organization consistently guide him in his current career.
